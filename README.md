|app-configmap.yaml|a Kubernetes YAML manifest for a Pod named 'app-config' with specific configurations for environment variables and volume mounts. The Pod should contain a single container named 'mypod' using the Redis image. Ensure the image pull policy is set to 'Always' to always pull the latest image. Define an environment variable 'CONFIGMAP_PARAM' in the container, which retrieves its value from a key named 'config-param' in a ConfigMap called 'app-config'. Additionally, mount a volume in the container at the path '/config'. This volume should be linked to the same ConfigMap 'app-config', making its data available inside the container. Set the Pod's restart policy to 'Never', indicating that it should not automatically restart|Utilize ConfigMap in environment variables and a volume mount|[app-configmap.yaml](yaml/app-configmap.yaml?raw=true)|
